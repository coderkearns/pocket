    <h1>Pocket</h1>
    <p>A collection of truly tiny utilities, written in javascript.</p>
</div>

## Description

A collection of a number of javascript utilities and design patterns. All utilities are extremely small and simple, and have no dependencies. Heavily inspired by the work of [@ai](https://github.com/ai/), specifically his "nano" projects like [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) and [nanoevents](https://github.com/ai/nanoevents).

### Simple Usage
